Bibledit Cloud Configuration

All configuration files reside in the config folder.

When Bibledit Cloud runs behind a proxy server, Bibledit is not able to find out its own URL that faces the user. The user-facing URL can be set through a configuration file. The name of the configuration file is userfacingurl.conf and it contains the URL, for example: https://bibledit.org:8081
