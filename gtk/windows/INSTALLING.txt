This is a description of how to install bibledit-gtk on Windows.
It assumes you have already gone through the BUILDING process.

As Administrator, run the MINGW Shell of your choice (32 or 64)

cd 32bit/bibledit/gtk
  or
cd 64bit/bibledit/gtk

./windows/installWin.sh

This will copy all necessary files from the bibledit repository,
the msys2 development environment, and it will fetch bwoutpost.exe
from the web for installation. It will install in either

32-bit:		C:\Program Files (x86)\Bibledit-x.y.z\
64-bit:		C:\Program Files\Bibledit-x.y.z\

Inside of that directory, you will see
	editor\bin
	editor\lib
	editor\share
	
You can execute bibledit-gtk from editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe

Create an icon on your desktop or in your Start Menu and you are good
to go!
