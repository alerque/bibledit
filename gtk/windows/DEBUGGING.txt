This is a description of how to debug bibledit-gtk on Windows.
It assumes you have already gone through the BUILDING process
and the INSTALLING process.

General Debugging
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you are a hardy soul, you can run gdb from the DOS command
   line. It works. cd to the bibledit-gtk.exe directory, then 
   run \msys64\mingw64\bin\gdb

2. In the past I have preferred to use gdb from emacs. Run 
   /mingw64/bin/emacs &
   from an msys64 shell. Once in emacs, do M-x (Alt-X) and type
   gud-gdb <enter>. Then type
   gdb --fullname "C:/Program Files/Bibledit-4.9.3/editor/bin/bibledit-gtk.exe"
   This will start gdb and then you can use the commands n, p, 
   l, etc, or the buttons at the top of the emacs window to step
   and so forth.

3. I like Notepad++ for editing source code, but compiling
   (not to mention debugging) are not really strong points of
   Notepad++.

4. Eclipse. ?

VERY INCOMPLETE. DR MEMORY HAS BROKEN FOR ME, SO I'M NOT DONE
HERE.

Memory Debugging
----------------------------------------------------------------
I use Dr. Memory, from http://drmemory.org/
The binary I downloaded is at 
https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory/releases/download/release_1.10.0/DrMemory-Windows-1.10.0-2.msi

You can drag-and-drop the C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.3\bibledit-gtk.exe
file onto the Dr. Memory icon. It will run its memory checks. But then 
the question is, where is the log file? It should pop up when Dr. Memory
finishes its analysis. Its files sit in C:\users\username\AppData\Roaming\Dr. Memory\*

I would prefer to run from command line:

C:
cd \Users\username
mkdir DrMemLog
drmemory -logdir C:\Users\postiffm\DrMemLog "C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.3\editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe"

but then bibledit-gtk doesn't seem to run fully. Running as administrator doesnt' fix the problem.

If the program doesn't seem to do anything, and you see a message after you quit:
Dr. Memory failed to start the target application, perhaps due to
interference from invasive security software.
Try disabling other software or running in a virtual machine.

then you have to do this:
