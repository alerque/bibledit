This is a description of how to debug bibledit-gtk on Windows.
It assumes you have already gone through the BUILDING process
and the INSTALLING process.

General Debugging
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you are a hardy soul, you can run gdb from the DOS command
   line. It works. 
   cd C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.4\
   \msys64\mingw64\bin\gdb editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe
		or
   cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Bibledit-4.9.4\ or 
   \msys64\mingw32\bin\gdb editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe   
   
2. In the past I have preferred to use gdb from emacs. Run 
   /mingw64/bin/emacs & or your stock Windows version of emacs
   from an msys64 shell. Once in emacs, do M-x (Alt-X) and type
   gud-gdb <enter> and run it this way:
   C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\gdb --fullname "C:/Program Files/Bibledit-4.9.4/editor/bin/bibledit-gtk.exe"   
	  or for 32-bit
   C:\msys64\mingw32\bin\gdb --fullname "C:/Program Files (x86)/Bibledit-4.9.3/editor/bin/bibledit-gtk.exe"
   cd .. a couple of times to get back to the bibledit-4.9.4 directory
   set args --debug
   Set breakpoints (Ctrl)
   This will start gdb and then you can use the commands n, p, 
   l, etc, or the buttons at the top of the emacs window to step
   and so forth.
   
   // Following doesn't quite work for some reason - application doesn't start all the way.
   Using Windows-native Emacs, I do the same, and run this:
   \msys64\mingw32\bin\gdb --fullname "C:/Program Files (x86)/Bibledit-4.9.3/editor/bin/bibledit-gtk.exe"
   cd "C:/Program Files (x86)/Bibledit-4.9.3/" or whatever syntax works to get to that directory
   run

3. I like Notepad++ for editing source code, but compiling
   (not to mention debugging) are not really strong points of
   Notepad++.

4. Eclipse. ?

VERY INCOMPLETE. DR MEMORY HAS BROKEN FOR ME, SO I'M NOT DONE
HERE. 4/9/2016 I can fix this now. Just need time to do it.

Memory Debugging
----------------------------------------------------------------
I use Dr. Memory, from http://drmemory.org/
The binary I downloaded is at 
https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory/releases/download/release_1.10.0/DrMemory-Windows-1.10.0-2.msi

You can drag-and-drop the C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.3\bibledit-gtk.exe
file onto the Dr. Memory icon. It will run its memory checks. But then 
the question is, where is the log file? It should pop up when Dr. Memory
finishes its analysis. Its files sit in C:\users\username\AppData\Roaming\Dr. Memory\*

I would prefer to run from command line:

C:
cd \Users\username
mkdir DrMemLog
drmemory -logdir C:\Users\postiffm\DrMemLog "C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.3\editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe"

but then bibledit-gtk doesn't seem to run fully. Running as administrator doesn't fix the problem.

If the program doesn't seem to do anything, and you see a message after you quit:
Dr. Memory failed to start the target application, perhaps due to
interference from invasive security software.
Try disabling other software or running in a virtual machine.

then you have to do this:
