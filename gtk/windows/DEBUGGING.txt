This is a description of how to debug bibledit-gtk on Windows.

VERY INCOMPLETE. DR MEMORY HAS BROKEN FOR ME, SO I'M NOT DONE
HERE.

Memory Debugging
----------------------------------------------------------------
I use Dr. Memory, from http://drmemory.org/
The binary I downloaded is at https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory/releases/download/release_1.10.0/DrMemory-Windows-1.10.0-2.msi

You can drag-and-drop the C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.3\bibledit-gtk.exe
file onto the Dr. Memory icon. It will run its memory checks. But then 
the question is, where is the log file? It can be hard to locate.

So I prefer to run from command line:

C:
cd \Users\username
mkdir DrMemLog
drmemory -logdir C:\Users\postiffm\DrMemLog "C:\Program Files\Bibledit-4.9.3\editor\bin\bibledit-gtk.exe"

If you see
Dr. Memory failed to start the target application, perhaps due to
interference from invasive security software.
Try disabling other software or running in a virtual machine.

then you have to do this:
