How to include the SQlite library.
1. Download the native 32 or 64 bits SQLite DLL from http://sqlite.org.
2. Extract the files sqlite3.dll and sqlite3.def and place them in the project’s source folder.
3. Open a “Developer Command Prompt for VS2015” and navigate to this source folder.
4. Create an import library using the following command line: LIB /DEF:sqlite3.def
5. Add the library (that is sqlite3.lib) to the Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Additional Dependencies.
6. Download SQlite amalgamation with the same version number from http://sqlite.org.
7. Unzip the sqlite3.h header file and place it into the source directory.
You will need to include the sqlite3.dll in the same directory as your program, or in a System Folder.
