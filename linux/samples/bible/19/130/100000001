\c 130
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.
\q1
\v 2 Lord, hear my voice.
\q2 Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.
\q1
\v 3 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins,
\q2 Lord, who could stand?
\q1
\v 4 But there is forgiveness with you,
\q2 therefore you are feared.
\q1
\v 5 I wait for Yahweh.
\q2 My soul waits.
\q2 I hope in his word.
\q1
\v 6 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning;
\q2 more than watchmen for the morning.
\q1
\v 7 Israel, hope in Yahweh,
\q2 for with Yahweh there is loving kindness.
\q2 With him is abundant redemption.
\q1
\v 8 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
